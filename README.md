This register was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), based on the [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) example.

## Local testing

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

Following the advice of Next.js' creators, we deployed the project using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), created by the  
creators of Next.js

After deployment, we used a different Name Server for CNaming the URL to [registro.bandalurago.it](https://registro.bandalurago.it)
